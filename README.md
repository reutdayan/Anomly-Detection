# Anomaly-Detector-time-Series
A C++ project as part of Advanced Programming 1 course at Bar Ilan University.
Implements Anomaly Detector:
1.	Learn - receive data,learn it by inserting it into database and analyzing it.
2.	Detect - receive new data and checking if it has any anomalies, by comparing it to existing data(from learn).

It can detect anomalies using 2 different methods:
1.	Linear regression.
2.	Circular - using Welzl algorithm.

with a server using TCP protocol, and CLI to receive user requests.

## Main Achievements
* Implementing Design Patterns and Architectures(Command, Bridge, Client-Server, etc).
* Using network protocols.
* Working with data structures and STL.
* Maintaining data(files and network).
* Implementing algorithms into a program.
* Concurrency programming using threads.
